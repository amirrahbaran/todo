This app is being provided for rearranging the todo tasks management

## Demo page:

### Todos:

* When I click on the right cross icon then the todo-item should be deleted

* On the bottom left of the list, the number of left undone items should be displayed (ie: 2 items left)

* On the bottom middle of the list, three filtering options (All, Active, Completed) should be displayed:
  ** All: All items should be displayed
  ** Active: Only undone items should be displayed
  ** Completed: Only completed items should be displayed

* On the bottom right of the list, a "Clear completed" link should be located

* when click on "Clear completed", all completed items should be deleted
