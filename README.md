This app is being provided for rearranging the todo tasks management

### Demo page:

### Todos:

- [x] When I hit "Enter" key, then the todo-item should be added to the list

- [x] When I click on the right cross icon, then the todo-item should be deleted

- [x] On the bottom left of the list, the total number of leftover items should be displayed (ie: <i>2 items left</i>)

- [x] On the bottom middle of the list, three filtering options (<i>All, Active, Completed</i>) should be displayed:
    - [x] <b>All:</b> All items should be displayed 
    - [x] <b>Active:</b> Only leftover items should be displayed
    - [x] <b>Completed:</b> Only completed items should be displayed

- [x] On the bottom right of the list, a <b>Clear Completed</b> link should be located

- [x] When click on <b>Clear Completed</b>, all the completed items should be deleted at once
